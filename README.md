# Flow - Get it done

## Description
This is a simple, minimal todo list app. It will allow you to add tasks and remove tasks.

### Tools Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### Note
This was a great project to reinforce my knowledge of the DOM. This project helped me to better understand DOM manipulation. I found that selecting the appopriate elements and creating the proper logic to remove the elements to be a roadblock but I was able to utilize stackoverflow and MDN to overcome this challenge.
